I just handed in my notice at Goldman Sachs. I was going to refer to this in the title of this post but I realised that 'Why I left Goldman Sachs' is already the title of a rather unfortunate op-ed in the New York Times.

So I decided to title it 'Why I'm Joining Entrepreneur First', because that's what I'm doing, and that's what I want to focus on, not what I'm leaving behind.
