<p>Last week I quit my job as a software developer at Goldman Sachs to start my own company, helped by the fantastic <a href="http://www.joinef.com/">Entrepreneur First</a>. When I informed my colleagues of my impending departure I was surprised by their overwhelmingly positive reactions. I had expected a mixture of incredulity and disdain that I would turn my back on such a great job and career, especially for something as uncertain and seemingly risky as starting a company. Everyone was surprised, but they also seemed to be genuinely excited for me. </p>

<p>My job was indeed very comfortable, I was paid a high salary (arguably too high, but what investment banks pay their employees is a discussion for a different time!), I worked reasonable hours, and my job didn’t involve doing anything I didn’t particularly want to do. I would hesitate to say I was ‘passionate’ about the work I was doing (whatever that actually means…), but neither did I find it particularly burdensome, and I did get a large amount of flexibility in my work and opportunity to learn new things, albeit mostly in proprietary technologies used solely at Goldman.</p>

<p>Despite being very supportive of my decision, most people were curious about why I decided to leave, so I’m going to attempt to provide an answer in this post. First of all it’s worth pointing out the <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/white-male-privilege-squandered-on-job-at-best-buy,35835">privilege</a> I enjoy simply by having this decision in the first place. Not everyone is in the position to take on such uncertainty around their income and career for the foreseeable future, so I consider myself lucky to have the freedom that I do.</p>

<p>When I received my offer for Entrepreneur First it took a long time to commit wholeheartedly to leaving Goldman. Deep down I knew I was going to leave as soon as I received the offer, it just took a while to rationalise it to myself (not to mention my parents). I’ve always dreamed of having my own company and I knew that this is what I wanted to do, but when you're faced with deciding between a safe, dependable career with certain rewards versus an exciting but difficult career as an entrepreneur with highly uncertain rewards, the reality of the decision is always going to be harder than the theoretical version. It's also important to make a conscious, well thought through decision rather than letting momentum or impulse carry you one way or the other.</p>

<p>I think the main point is that I left for entirely positive reasons. I am joining a program called Entrepreneur First, which helps graduates to build tech startups, they provide investment along with an environment which is highly conducive to building an awesome company. It makes the process of founding a company infinitely easier than it would otherwise be, and I'm incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to take part in EF.</p>

<p>It was only after spending a lot of time weighing up both options that the decision to join EF started to seem less risky than I initially thought. The way I think about risk has been heavily influenced by one of my favourite writers, Nassim Taleb. To take the liberty of paraphrasing, he argues that there is no way you are going to be able to control every risk, it's better to limit your downside; your worst case scenario, while positioning yourself to benefit from uncertainty and randomness. The parallels to my decision were clear; staying in a steady career with a big company is ostensibly less risky, but the downside of being made redundant a few years down the line is high, I would be left with highly specific skills in proprietary technologies, and have the stigma of redundancy hanging over my CV. Contrast that with being self employed; regardless of the outcome of Entrepreneur First I will have gained a wealth of experience and learned a host of new skills, some of which would be bound to lead to new jobs and opportunites, even if I don't end up owning a billion dollar tech company! Plus, I can't think of anyone <i>better</i> placed to benefit from randomness and uncertainty than an entrepreneur.
</p>

<p>This leads me to my new life motto: "It's better to be awesome than rich". I stole this from somewhere else but I can't remember where I read it. To me this basically means that in your career you should pursue personal excellence and learning over financial reward. I think this will be increasingly important in the future. We're already starting to see signs that tomorrow’s job market will look entirely different from our current conception of what it means to have a career. Technologies and opportunities move so fast that the idea of a stable job is becoming rarer and rarer. Surely it's better to have rapid learning, creativity and the ability to work under highly uncertain conditions built into your career from day one, essentially to be an entrepreneur. By focusing purely on how you can improve yourself and build awesome things, you will surely be better off in the long run, in terms of career satisfaction if not financially, than pursuing a narrow definition of success (ie. a financial one) from the outset.</p>

<p>My decision to apply to EF was strongly influenced by Paul Graham's <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html">essay</a> on wealth creation. There's an important difference between creating wealth and receiving money, even though they are often related. By working at Goldman Sachs I would doubtless receive more money than I will in the next few years of being an entrepreneur, but I can't convince myself that I would be creating more value there. I don't think I would advise anyone to become an entrepreneur based on a calculation of expected career earnings. The numbers don't work out, the chances of hitting the big time are just too low. But that doesn't mean that a career devoted to entrepreneurship doesn't have a larger return in terms of wealth creation for society. I believe it does, but I imagine that would be a subject of some debate. I also believe wealth creation is a better goal than wealth accummulation, but they are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>There's only so much logic you can use in a decision like this, I think one of the most important things is that I'm genuinely excited about becoming an entrepreneur. Mainly because it means I get to wear shorts to work, not something that you can do at the average investment bank, but it also means ultimate freedom about how I live my life, even though it probably will be much harder work!</p>

<p>It's important to make the realisation that you don’t actually have to work for anyone else, and it's something that might escape you at the average university careers fair. By taking the decision to work for yourself you probably aren’t going to become fantastically rich, but if you have the drive and ability to make it at a big company and you instead channel that into your own work, then eventually you are going to be able to find something that someone will pay you money to do, and hopefully have some fun along the way.</p>
